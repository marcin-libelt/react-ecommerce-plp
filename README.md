# Ecommerce PLP with ReactJs

## About the feature

React PLP based on **ReactJs** v 16 was intended to be an interactive and fast way to filter and browse the product list.
The Sales Manolo Blahnik store is invite-only, so we didn't worry too much about SEO or SSR for React.

Communication with Magento takes place via **GraphQL** queries.
The feature, like the entire store, was built and adapted to the needs of users with limitations.

## About the project
